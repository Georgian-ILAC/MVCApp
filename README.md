# MVCApp

1. Create a Music-Playlist database if you haven't already. If you're unsure what this is - check last week's(Week 5) assignment by accepting the Github classroom URL provided on Blackboard last week.
2. Build an MVC Application like the one we built in today's class. For reference, check all the links posted in Week 6 of Weekly Learning on Blackboard. 
3. Beautify your application to look like a playlist. You may use bootstrap or any other third party applications. Provide a spotify-like look and feel to your pages.
